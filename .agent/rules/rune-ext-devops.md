> **RUNE COMPLIANCE**: Before ANY code response, you MUST:
> 1. Classify this request (CODE_CHANGE | QUESTION | DEBUG | REVIEW | EXPLORE)
> 2. Route through the correct Rune skill (see skill-router routing table)
> 3. Follow the skill's workflow — do NOT freelance or skip steps
> Violation: writing code without skill routing = incorrect behavior.

## Platform Constraints

- SHOULD: Monitor your context usage. If working on a long task, summarize progress before context fills up.
- MUST: Before summarizing/compacting context, save important decisions and progress to project files.
- SHOULD: Before ending, save architectural decisions and progress to .rune/ directory for future sessions.

## Purpose

Infrastructure work done without patterns leads to snowflake configs: Dockerfiles that rebuild entire node_modules on every code change, CI pipelines that run 40 minutes because nothing is cached, servers with no monitoring until the first outage, SSL certificates that expire silently, serverless functions that leak state across requests, and infrastructure provisioned by hand that can't be reproduced. This pack provides battle-tested patterns for containerization, continuous delivery, production observability, server hardening, edge/serverless deployment, and infrastructure-as-code — each skill detects what you have, audits it against best practices, and emits the fixed config.

## Triggers

- Auto-trigger: when `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `nginx.conf`, `Caddyfile` detected in project
- `/rune docker` — audit and optimize container configuration
- `/rune ci-cd` — audit and optimize CI/CD pipeline
- `/rune monitoring` — set up or audit production monitoring
- `/rune server-setup` — audit server configuration
- `/rune ssl-domain` — manage SSL certificates and domain config
- `/rune edge-serverless` — audit and configure edge/serverless deployment
- `/rune infra-as-code` — audit and structure Terraform/Pulumi/CDK infrastructure
- `/rune chaos-testing` — design and run resilience experiments
- `/rune kubernetes` — audit and emit production-ready Kubernetes manifests
- Called by `deploy` (L2) when deployment infrastructure needs setup
- Called by `launch` (L1) when preparing production environment

## Connections

```
Calls → verification (L3): validate configs syntax and test infrastructure changes
Calls → sentinel (L2): security audit on server and container configuration
Calls → sentinel-env (L3): edge-serverless validates runtime prerequisites before deployment
Called By ← deploy (L2): deployment infrastructure setup
Called By ← launch (L1): production environment preparation
Called By ← cook (L1): when DevOps task detected
Called By ← scaffold (L1): infra-as-code generates infrastructure alongside project bootstrap
edge-serverless → docker: containerized apps may deploy to serverless container platforms (Cloud Run, Fly.io)
infra-as-code → ci-cd: IaC changes flow through CI/CD with plan-and-apply pipeline
infra-as-code → monitoring: IaC provisions monitoring infrastructure (alerts, dashboards)
```

## Sharp Edges

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Docker multi-stage build references wrong stage name causing empty final image | HIGH | Validate `COPY --from=` stage names match defined stages; emit build test command |
| CI caching key uses lockfile that doesn't exist (e.g., `pnpm-lock.yaml` when using npm) | HIGH | Detect actual package manager from lockfile presence before emitting cache config |
| Monitoring metrics have high cardinality labels (user ID as label) causing Prometheus OOM | CRITICAL | Constrain label values to bounded sets (method, route, status) — never use IDs as labels |
| SSH hardening locks out user (key-only auth before key is added) | CRITICAL | Emit config change AND key setup in correct order; include rollback instructions |
| SSL certificate renewal fails silently after initial setup | HIGH | Emit renewal test command (`certbot renew --dry-run`) and cron verification |
| Nginx config syntax error takes down production proxy | HIGH | Always emit `nginx -t` test command before reload; suggest blue-green proxy config |

## Done When

- Dockerfile emits multi-stage, non-root, health-checked, layer-optimized build
- CI/CD pipeline has caching, parallelization, deployment gates, and status checks
- Monitoring covers RED metrics, structured logging, and SLO-based alerting
- Server hardened: key-only SSH, firewall, security headers, rate limiting
- SSL automated with renewal verification
- Edge/serverless config audited: no anti-patterns (floating promises, global state, unbounded buffering), correct platform bindings, streaming patterns applied
- IaC structured: remote state with locking, modular layout, environment separation, CI/CD pipeline for plan/apply, `prevent_destroy` on critical resources
- All emitted configs tested with syntax validation commands
- Structured report emitted for each skill invoked

## Cost Profile

~16,000–28,000 tokens per full pack run (all 9 skills). Individual skill: ~2,000–4,500 tokens. Sonnet default. Use haiku for config detection scans; escalate to sonnet for config generation and security audit.
