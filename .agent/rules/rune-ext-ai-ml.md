> **RUNE COMPLIANCE**: Before ANY code response, you MUST:
> 1. Classify this request (CODE_CHANGE | QUESTION | DEBUG | REVIEW | EXPLORE)
> 2. Route through the correct Rune skill (see skill-router routing table)
> 3. Follow the skill's workflow — do NOT freelance or skip steps
> Violation: writing code without skill routing = incorrect behavior.

## Platform Constraints

- SHOULD: Monitor your context usage. If working on a long task, summarize progress before context fills up.
- MUST: Before summarizing/compacting context, save important decisions and progress to project files.
- SHOULD: Before ending, save architectural decisions and progress to .rune/ directory for future sessions.

## Purpose

AI-powered features fail in predictable ways: LLM calls without retry logic that crash on rate limits, RAG pipelines that retrieve irrelevant chunks because the chunking strategy ignores document structure, embedding search that returns semantic matches with zero keyword overlap, fine-tuning runs that overfit because the eval set leaked into training data, AI agents that leak state across requests or lose progress on crashes, and code interpreters that execute untrusted LLM output without isolation. This pack codifies production patterns for each — from API client resilience to retrieval quality to model evaluation to agent state management to secure sandboxed execution — so AI features ship with the reliability of traditional software.

## Triggers

- Auto-trigger: when `openai`, `anthropic`, `@langchain`, `pinecone`, `pgvector`, `embedding`, `llm` detected in dependencies or code
- `/rune llm-integration` — audit or improve LLM API usage
- `/rune rag-patterns` — build or audit RAG pipeline
- `/rune embedding-search` — implement or optimize semantic search
- `/rune fine-tuning-guide` — prepare and execute fine-tuning workflow
- `/rune ai-agents` — design and build stateful AI agents
- `/rune code-sandbox` — set up secure code execution for AI
- `/rune web-extraction` — build structured data extraction from web pages
- `/rune deep-research` — implement iterative AI research loops with convergence
- Called by `cook` (L1) when AI/ML task detected
- Called by `plan` (L2) when AI architecture decisions needed

## Sharp Edges

- **Rate limits**: MUST implement exponential backoff retry on all LLM API calls — guaranteed at scale.
- **Schema validation**: MUST validate LLM output with Zod/Pydantic — never trust raw text parsing.
- **Eval leakage**: MUST separate training and evaluation datasets — leakage invalidates all metrics.
- **Similarity thresholds**: MUST set thresholds on vector search — unrestricted results degrade quality.
- **PII in embeddings**: MUST NOT embed sensitive data without consent — not easily deletable from vector stores.
- **Embedding model pinning**: Pin model version in index metadata — dimension mismatch on upgrade is CRITICAL.
- **Prompt injection**: Web pages may contain adversarial content targeting extraction LLMs — system prompt must block.
- **Sandbox escape**: Use rootless Docker or gVisor for high-security code execution environments.

## Done When

- LLM API client implemented with retry logic, exponential backoff, and structured output validation via Zod/Pydantic
- RAG pipeline operational: chunking, embedding, vector store, retrieval, and reranking all configured and tested
- Embedding index metadata includes pinned model version and dimension count to prevent upgrade mismatches
- AI agent state persists across requests with no cross-session leakage and graceful crash recovery

## Cost Profile

~24,000–40,000 tokens per full pack run (all 10 skills). Individual skill: ~2,500–5,000 tokens. Sonnet default. Use haiku for code detection scans; escalate to sonnet for pipeline design, extraction strategy, and research loop orchestration.
